## Lab_2
Student name: Sofiane Ennadir

Implementation of Lab 2 which consists of fine-tuning a model and deploying a platform to use it using Gradio and HuggingFace.

Unfortunetly I couldn't yet resolve the problem of the GPU compatibility with the hugging face space (I don't have a GPU access).

I tried different parameters of the model but couldn't try more than one epoch as my access to Google Colab was cut at one point.

Please find example of the platform deployed on local in the provided screenshot.
